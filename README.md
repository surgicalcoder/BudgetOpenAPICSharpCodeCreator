# Welcome to Yet Another Budget OpenAPI to C# Generator

Oh, look—another OpenAPI to C# code generator. Just what the world needed, right? This one is intentionally minimalistic, painfully simple, and—let's be honest—pretty underwhelming. But hey, that's exactly the point.

## Why should you use it?
- It's cheap. Like, really cheap. Almost embarrassingly so. Like 100% free, without any support, or care if it works or not.
- It has very few features because who needs complexity when you just want code? Unit tests? Hah, that's what production is for!
- It works (mostly). And when it doesn't, it's your problem, not mine.
- This was 100% vibe coded by both ChatGPT and Claude AI. 

## Features (or lack thereof)

- Generates C# .NET 9.0 client code from OpenAPI specs.
- No fancy options, configurations, or unnecessary bells and whistles.
- Designed specifically for people who hate complexity and love doing the absolute minimum.

## Who this is NOT for:

- If you're expecting cutting-edge features, please use literally anything else.
- If you love overengineering solutions, kindly show yourself out.
- If you're annoyed by this attitude, fantastic—mission accomplished!

## Still here?

Great. You're either exactly who this was made for or you enjoy a bit of self-inflicted frustration. Either way, welcome aboard.

Now, please go use it or complain loudly. Both outcomes are equally satisfying.

PRs are welcome, if they fit along with the criteria of making things simple but also configurable. If you want an IAbstractFactoryProviderFactoryHandler, this isn't the project for you.
